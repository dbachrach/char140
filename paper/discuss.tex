\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discuss}

In this section, we discuss a variety of issues and future extensions of the Hoot design.

\subsection{Deployment}

How could Twitter roll out a service like \hoot? Twitter would not need to go far to have all the meta data necessary to encrypt and decrypt for their users. They would need an interface to allow users to mark a tweet as encrypted, and everything in the tweet would bee encrypted using the hashtag in the message as the plain tag. As we showed previously, fitting into the 140 character limit is possible with Unicode encryption, but Twitter could easily make an internal exception for \hoot. We also showed that computation for encryption and decryption is negligible. One computer can do it, and Twitter has entire racks of computers. The real issue is how the \hoot system would affect bandwidth for Twitter. The bandwidth would increase based on the group collisions and the number of Hoots to a group. Users no longer follow a single tag and read everything. They subscribe to a Short Tag, which collides with many other groups, and therefore they must see all the noise of the other groups on their Short Tag. Fundamentally, Twitter has to pay for the receiver anonymity inherent in the \hoot protocol.

%\hlfixme{Someone double check this reasoning:} 
For $N$ groups who collide onto $S$ Short Tags with each group posting $M$ messages, the added bandwidth would be $M\frac{N}{S}$ as opposed to the original bandwidth of $M$. This accounts only for group messages, when in reality there are many more tweets that do not have hashtags. The bandwidth additions for \hoot might be very small compared to the bandwidth used to send ordinary non-group messages.

According to Sandler and Wallach~\cite{sandler09}, Twitter users, on average, send 100 messages and have 100 followers. It is difficult to know how many groups (hashtags) users post to, but it is even more difficult to know how many users listen to a particular group. After Sen. Jon Kyl made an inaccurate statement, his spokesperson cleared it up by saying it was ``not intended to be a factual statement''~\cite{politico11}. Stephen Colbert then encouraged his followers to tweet using the hashtag \#NotIntendedToBeAFactualStatement. This quickly became a popular Twitter group, but it is impossible to know how many people were actually listening to the group but not posting. Even those posting to the group might not be listening to all the other tweets to the group. We could treat the number of posters and the number of listeners as equivalent, but that is not intended to be a factual statement.

Regardless of the number of groups or Short Tags, Twitter's bandwidth bill would certainly go up, and since their finances are already dubious, implementing \hoot may be a concern.

\subsection{Adoption}	

The next question to ask after we have shown that rolling out the Hoot service is feasible would be whether Twitter would actually implement such a feature. Based on the nature of Twitter, we believe that Twitter would not add a secure messaging framework like Hoot. Twitter as a company needs to know what people are talking about, so it can provide relevant advertisement. Adding the Hoot infrastructure to Twitter would prevent Twitter from knowing the content of the messages, and so we believe the Hoot service will never be adopted. However, this need not prevent individuals from using the Hoot protocol over Twitter. As long as Twitter faithfully delivers tweets, users are free to run the Hoot encryption on their own machines over their messages and then post the output to Twitter. In fact, this method is more secure in that a user only has to trust their machine. If Twitter is responsible for encrypting a message, nothing is stopping them from keeping a copy of the plain text message. Paranoid users will always want to encrypt messages themselves, so Twitter adopting the Hoot protocol is unnecessary.
		
\subsection{Usability}

As described in the Cover Traffic section, a group can deliberately collide with a popular tag by concatenating an easily rememberable string of text with random letters or numbers. As Miller~\cite{miller56} noted, people can remember  
7 +/- 2 unique packets of data, so as long as these collisions can be generated with a suffix in that range a user is likely to be able to remember it. We could further improve rememberability by restricting suffix values to only digits, and then generate a suffix of 7 or 10 digits, emulating a phone number. The main requirement is that a group should be able to have a unique shared secret that can deliberately collide with other tags while still being easy to remember and more importantly easy to transfer. Since our proposal does not deal with key transfer, we assume our key communication is done through whisper channels and thus must be short and memorizable for simple transfer. We have found that a collision can be found with only appending 3-6 characters to a prefix, so deliberate collisions can both be found and transferred without much effort. By brute-forcing to find a collision, the string of characters after the prefix  can be considered "random." Yan et. al~\cite{yan00} discussed random and mnemonic passwords. Our string of characters will rarely be mnemonic, so it suffers from the issues they mentioned like users forgetting the password, but on the other hand random passwords are stronger than mnemonics as shown by Kuo et. al.~\cite{passwords06}.

To make the system even more usable, the client or Twitter should automatically find groups for the user to collide with rather than the user finding it by hand. This system could even allow the user to tweak a parameter for how active a group to collide with.

\subsection{Adaptability}

Since Hoot benefits from and encourages collision, there will come a point when there is too much collision, i.e. there will be too much noise to signal for a specific group when following an identifier that collides with many groups. At some point, the entire Hoot universe will want to decrease the amount of collisions. The simple solution is to increase the Short Tag length. Whenever there is too many collisions, the Short Tag length will be increased by one, which will result in far less collisions until the communication increases and eventually the cycle continues. 

The nature of Hoot makes it convenient for this Short Tag length tuning to be done at the system level or at the group level. For instance, a group that is overrun with collisions with popular group could simply increase their Short Tag length internally. All Hoots would include the extra character in the Short Tag, and all subscribes would search for the longer Short Tag. It is also as simple for the entire system to switch to a longer identifier by having an ``oracle'' broadcast to everyone that the system Short Tag length has increased.

Even in a distributed system where some users may not receive the oracle's broadcast, the system still functions. For example, assume user $A$ is following a group who's Long Tag begins ``A5trxq...'', and in $A$'s view, Short Tags should be 2 characters. For user $B$, who posts messages to the group, the Short Tag length should be 3. $B$'s Hoot would then look like ``\#A5t'', but $A$ would be searching for ``\#A5". Twitter's search functionality will still return $B$'s messages for $A$'s search. Although $A$ will be getting much more noise than signal when they search at the shorter length, they will not miss any Hoots.

Previously, we stated that a Short Tag is the first K bytes of the Long Tag, so we explicitly put a limit onto how long a Short Tag can be. Does this prevent us from adapting to an ever growing Hoot ecosystem? In our implementation, we use the first 16 bytes of the Long Tag for identification. Therefore using Base64 encoding, we get $62^{16}$ or $4\times10^{28}$ unique identifiers. In a system with 16 byte Short Tags, there would rarely if ever be collisions, much less too many collisions to increase the length.

Finally, as a result of the encoding systems, the size of the Short Tag space increases by a large factor for each character added. This takes a space that is highly populated to a space that is very sparse, so it is very possible that by adding one character to tag identifiers that groups would be uniquely identified. Groups that also deliberately collided with another group would often not collide at a longer Short Tag length. It would be convenient to instead grow the space by single bits at a time, so as to double the space, a much smaller factor. Unfortunately, Twitter is a character driven environment rather than bit driven, so this is difficult to address. It also does not deal with deliberate collisions. All deliberate collisions will need to be regenerated after a Short Tag length increase.

\subsection{Alternate Backends}

Even though our protocol was designed with Twitter in mind, it is extensible to other systems and platforms. The Hoot protocol describes a secure way to transfer short messages (with short encryption overhead) across a publicly available network completely openly. Twitter is a great example of this environment but not the only one. Hoot could interact, for example, with a Distributed Hash Table system (DHT) like CHORD or Pastry. Importantly, Hoot can interface with both centralized systems like Twitter or Buzz or decentralized systems. As long as the platform's content is publicly searchable, the Hoot protocol allows secure transmission to anonymous group followers.
