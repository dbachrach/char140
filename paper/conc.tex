\section{Conclusions}

\hlfixme{TODO: we have a usability / entropy trade off. it would be great if we could have a better key distribution system.}

\hlfixme{
-- Deliberate posting crap (to hide your stuff).
-- Increases work factor (signal to noise)
-- Fairly strong attacker, but user who don't have ability for a lot of entropy
-- 70 bits is enough compared to the weakness of everything else
-- Discuss how we can make it harder for an attacker. Maybe hashing 1000 times...
