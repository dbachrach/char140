\section{Threat Model}

Our goal is to allow a user to send a secure message to a private group of individuals allowing only the group members to read the plain-text message. We wish to guarantee as much privacy as possible via an open public timeline like that of Twitter. We now discuss the threat model involved in evaluating the design decisions for the security protocol.

There are two entities which can attack this system. One is the service provider for the communication like Twitter. The other is an active third party observer who is either trying to gather information about what is being said or to whom it is being said.
 
Imagine an evil Twitter that can maliciously tamper with any of the tweets posted. Since Twitter has full control of the service, they act as an empowered man-in-the-middle between a secure message sender and the recipient group members. Our goals are to prevent Twitter or a third party from reading, creating, or altering a secure message, or discovering who the group recipients are.

Clearly, we cannot directly protect the identity of the secure message sender. A message must be posted to Twitter from some account. By definition, Twitter must know who that user is. We do not consider this limitation a security flaw, since it is fundamental to the problem description. However, if sender anonymity is required, tools like Tor could provide the needed indirection.

Twitter can simply refuse to post a tweet, which is a simple Denial of Service attack. Like any platform, protecting against DOS is nearly impossible. A slight modification to this, is the DDOS, which can be performed by other malicious Twitter users. A malicious user can deliberate tweet hundreds of thousands of messages with the public identifier of a group, which could possibly overload a user's search for the identifier with noise. Later we will describe how we prevent against this action and in fact utilize it to provide added security.

An attack that can be administered by Twitter or a third party is a replay attack. Since Twitter is a public forum, anyone can see the encrypted texts posted, and nothing prevents someone from simply copying such a message and posting it again. We want to protect against this threat.

A malicious Twitter also can take a valid Hoot and change the associated author or time that it displays with it. Our system does not directly prevent against these attacks, but they can be addressed by including the time stamp and author name with in the plain text of the message.

Finally, we want to prevent Twitter or any third party from gathering trending data on the encrypted posts. Even if they cannot read the messages, they can observe that someone is posting to the same group of recipients following certain patterns (such as daily at X time, or after major events), this repetition could compromise the group's identity by essentially creating a profile. This type of information is less of a concern to users of Twitter that are simply chatting, but one can imagine that this information can end up being used to identify spies. For example, by observing a pattern between company secrets being leaked to some competitor and a particular employee's secret tweets to a group just hours prior to each incident, the leaker could be identified. This attack can be prevented by using anonymizing services like Tor coupled with a collision technique we will describe later to create ``cover traffic.''
