\section{Introduction}

- Problem: Twitter like semantics w/ encrypted messages
	- Follow a Hash tag
	- Take hash tag and create something with crypto strength
	- Something derived from tags you can search on
	- But also deliberate collisions (cover traffic)
	
- Like to have thing that feels like twitter but anonymity properties:

- Twitter/Facebook relevant in Tunisia, (Social media playing big role in revolution across many countries. govt deliberately shut down)

- While we cannot keep them from filtering out service altogether,
want to have private communication in plain sight (not stenographic)

- Strong crypto usable by people whispering to each other in streets

- Only trusted channel is not electronic (spoken word), to exchange key.


- complimentary to Tor, solve problems Tor+Twitter does not

- What we are doing
-- Define a protocol for users to communicate over an insecure public network like twitter with message confidentiality and subscriber anonymity. 

- Punting on plain tag distribution

- Vocabulary
